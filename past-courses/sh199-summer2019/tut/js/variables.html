<h1> Variables and Assignment </h1>

<p> A variable in a programming language is a name given to some storage
  location for data.  You might think of it as a box that holds something or a
  piece of paper with something written on it, to keep the boxes or papers
  separate, we can name them.

<p> Variables are defined in JavaScript using the <kbd>var</kbd> keyword. Examples:
 <div class=code>var a;		// Defines a single variable named a, but doesn't anything with it.
var a, b;	// Defines variables a and b.
var thisIsAReallyLongVariableName;</div>

<p> Variables can also be defined with the <kbd>let</kbd> keyword, which defines
 a variable with a more limited "<i>scope</i>", but that is a discussion for a
 later time.  For the time being, just use <kbd>var</kbd> when defining a variable.

<p> <b>Keywords</b> in a language BTW, are words that have a very specific
 meaning in the language, usually to specifically instruct the computer to do
 something, and you're not usually allowed to make variables or functions that
 have the same name, so as not to confuse the computer.
 
<p> Variable names can have letters, numbers and underscores, but must begin
  with a letter or underscore:
<div class=code>var ok, _ok2;
var 3not_ok;</div>

<p> A variable cannot start with a number, because it would confuse the computer
  into thinking that what follows is a number, so the meaning becomes ambiguous.
  These rules for variable and function naming are intended to eliminate such
  ambiguity.

<p> Variables are assigned a value, using the <kbd>=</kbd> or assignment operator:
<div class=code>a = 10;</div>
<p> The <kbd>=</kbd> is not like in algebra.  The <kbd>=</kbd> operator stores
  the value on the right side into the variable specified on the left side.
  <kbd>=</kbd> is not to be confused w/ <kbd>==</kbd>, the equality test operator
  which is discussed in Boolean Logic.
<p> Until a variable is actually given a value, it is <b>undefined</b> and has
  the <b>undefined</b> "value".

<p> When variables are used on the right side of an assignment, we just use
  their values, with some exceptions.

<p> We can define a variable and assign it a value in one step:
<div class=code>var a = 10;</div>

<p>We can change it's value after we've defined it, repeatedly:
<div class=code>a = 2 + 10;	// Change a from 10 to (2+10) or 12
//...
a = "test";	// Now a holds the string "test"</div>

<p> Variables in JavaScript are
  "<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing'>loosely-typed</a>"
  or "<i>weakly typed</i>". They don't care what kind of data they hold, they
  can hold anything, this is not true in other programming languages, such as C
  or C++ which are "<i>strongly-typed</i>".

<p> You will note the <kbd>;</kbd> at the end of each variable assignment. Each
  assignment is a <i>statement</i> and <kbd>;</kbd> is the end-of-statement-marker
  and works much like the period at the end of a sentence.  You don't always
  need <kbd>;</kbd>'s in JavaScript, but you should always use them anyway.
  It's good grammar.

<p> What follows is a demonstration of how two variables <kbd>a</kbd> and
<kbd>b</kbd> change over time:

<div class=code>// value trace for:			a | b
//							--+--
var a, b;		//	undefined | undefined
  a = 5;		//			5 | undefined
  b = 10;		//			5 | 10
  a = a + b;	//	       15 | 10
  b = a - b;	//	       15 |  5
  a = "test";	//	   "test" |  5</div>

<h2>Assignment with operations:</h2>
<p> We often want to modify the value of a variable by adding or subtracting,
  etc things from it.  Normally this might be accomplished by:

  <div class=code>x = x + 2;	// Takes the value of x, adds two to it and assigns the new
		    // value back to x.</div>

 <p>There is a shortcut for the generalized form of:<br>
  <pre style='margin-left: 1in;'>x = x <b><i>op</i></b> <b><i>value</i></b>;</pre>

 <p> Where <b><i>op</i></b> is one of: <kbd>+, -, *, /, %, &amp;, |, ^, &lt;&lt;,
 >>, >>></kbd> or <kbd>**</kbd>, can be re-written as:<br>

  <pre style='margin-left: 1in;'>x <b><i>op</i></b>= <b><i>value</i></b>;</pre>

 <p>Example:
 <div class=code>x += 2;	// Same as x = x + 2;
x *= 5;	// Same as x = x * 5;</div>

</div>
