<h1> Introduction to JavaScript </h1>

<h3> What is a programming "Language"? </h3>
<ul>
 <li> Simply it is a <i>formal</i> (i.e. well-defined) language that is
    unambiguous as much as possible at all levels. Where in English words may
    have different meaning based on context, computers do not handle such
    ambiguity well and so formal languages try to eliminate such ambiguity as
    much as possible.  The upside is that the rules for the languages' grammar
    or the <i>syntax</i> of the language are very clearly defined, making it
    easier to learn than a Human language.
 <li> The purpose of the language is to instruct the computer, usually when
    given some input, to perform operations on the given <i>input</i>, producing
    some desired <i>output</i>.
 <li> In that respect a program is like a recipe, ingredients (input) in,
    something to eat out.
 <li> Computers only understand very simple things at the lowest levels, like:
   <ul>
    <li> Copy data from one place to another. (<i>assignment</i>)
    <li> Do numeric operations, such as addition and multiplication.
         (<i>expressions</i>)
    <li> Compare two values and determine if they are the same or not or if one
         is less or greater than the other. (<i>conditionals</i>,
         <i>Boolean logic</i>)
    <li> Jump around from one place to another in the program depending on the
         outcomes of the above comparisons. (<i>loops</i> and <i>functions</i>)
   </ul>
  <li> Computer languages attempt to abstract the simple things computers do to
    a higher level to make things easier for the programmer.  Some languages
    do so better than others.
  <li> Some languages may be described as <i>higher</i> or <i>lower</i> level.
    This is usually meant to describe how close the syntax is the "lowest" level
    language <i>assembly</i> or <i>machine language</i> (ML) which is the
    <i>native</i> language of any computer and consists of very simple
    instructions that individually usually do nothing more than one of the four
    above things.  Programming in assembly is usually regarded as tedious and
    often difficult, making for more mistakes that cause program crashes, especially
    for large programs. And so higher level languages were developed that made
    making mistakes less likely allowed the incorporation of libraries and more
    expressive code to abstract away common tasks that might take a lot of
    effort to develop in a lower level language.
</ul>

<h3> What is the "syntax" of a computer language? </h3>
<p> It is the grammar, or rules for the language, just as English does, computer
    languages have similar rules, but much more limited range of expression.

<p> Often times programmers may describe the syntax of a programming language in
    terms of Lego bricks.  Things like <i>statements</i> in such languages are
    like bricks that can then be snapped into a language anywhere a statement
    would go, and in this way assembling a program can be like snapping Lego
    bricks together.  You have many different kinds of <i>statements</i>, but
    any kind of statement can be snapped into a statement spot.  When learning
    a computer language it may be useful to employ this kind of mindset.

<p> For this class we will learn JavaScript aka
    <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript'>ECMAScript</a>.  It is
    incorporated into almost every browser, and also stand-alone as 
    interpreters/compilers such as <a href='http://nodejs.org'> node.js </a> or
    "node" and <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey'> SpiderMonkey </a>
    or "js".  One of the reasons for the choice of this language over others
    is that it should not disadvantage anyone moving on to CS201/CS202 which
    use C/C++ which are structurally similar, it is widely used in industry and
    so there are a large number of free online informational resources and
    coupled with a simple text editor and web browser, everyone already has a
    development environment installed on their computer, making the cost of
    entry into JavaScript development very low indeed.
