<h1>Functions</h1>
<p> Functions are an abstraction.  A sequence of code that is given a name, you
may think of them as mini or sub-programs. We make and use functions for a
number of reasons, including:
<ul>
 <li> <b>Code reuse</b> - rather than writing the same code over and over, we
   abstract the code into its own self-contained unit so we can "call" it from
   multiple within the larger program.
 <li> <b>Abstraction</b> - rather than thinking of a program as the whole of its
   parts we can use functions to abstract the program away into components that
   do "a task".  We can then think of a program in terms of its functional
   components, which may only be a numbered in the dozens, rather than the
   perhaps thousands of lines of code that make up those functions.  This allows
   the program to zoom-out from the code to a higher level and makes managing
   the complexity of a large problem much easier.
</ul>

<p>Functions in JavaScript are defined with the function keyword. Given:
<div class=code>function foo(a, b) {
  return a+b;
}</div>
</p>
<ul>
 <li>"<kbd>foo</kbd>" is the name of the function.
 <li> a and b here are "arguments" or "parameters" to the function.  They are
    variables that hold the values that are passed to the function in the same
    order.  A function may have zero or more arguments separated by commas and
    enclosed in ()'s.

 <li> The { ... } enclose the "statements" of the function, this is the function
    body.

 <li> The statement "<kbd>return a+b;</kbd>" tells the computer to return the
 result of a+b as this functions "value".  A return with no expression returns
 no value.
 <li> It is <i>called</i> or <i>invoked</i> by using it's name followed by the
  open and closing parenthesis "(...)" with any comma separated parameters to be
  passed to the function inside of them.  This can be done inside of any
  <i>expression</i> or <i>statement</i>.
 <li> Thus this function may then be used like so:
   <div class=code>var v = foo(1, 2);</div>
   <kbd>v</kbd> will be assigned the "return" value of foo, which is the
   result of adding 1 (stored in <kbd>a</kbd>) and 2 (stored in <kbd>b</kbd>)
   together.
</ul>

<h3> examples: </h3>
<div class=code>function ma(a, b, c) {
  return a*b + c;
}
var v = ma(1,2,3) + ma(3,4,5);
    v = (1*2+3)   + (3*4+5);
    v = 5         + 17;
    v = 22;</div>

<hr>
<div class=code>function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
  console.log("Hello, world!");
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}</div>

<p> This function just prints "<kbd>Hello, world!</kbd>" to the console log 3
  times and does nothing else.  It does not even return a value.  This kind of
  function is often called a <i>procedure</i>, it's used to abstract code into
  simpler to understand bite-sized chunks or to eliminate code repetition.  It
  would be used like so:

<div class=code>// Prints out "Hello, world!" 9 times:
hello(); hello(); hello();
</div>

<h2>Anonymous functions:</h2>
<p> These are functions that are created without a name, they can be assigned
    to a variable, so that it has a name.  Often they're just passed to a
    function as a "callback" function a function that the other function uses.<br>
  example:
<div class=code>var add = function(a, b) { // Note that there is no name following function.
  return a + b;
};
// The function is used in the normal way:
console.log(add(1,2));</div>

<h2>Variables and Scope:</h2>
<p> The <b><i>scope</i></b> of a variable is it's visibility to various areas
  inside the program.
<p> Variables declared with "<kbd>var</kbd>" inside of functions are
  <b><i>local</i></b> to the function. That is they are only visible or members
  of the function and don't exist outside of the function.  This includes the
  argument variables.
<p>Variables declared outside of the function are <b><i>global</i></b> and are
  visible inside of all functions.

<div class=code>var g = 1;

function foo(a, b) {
  g = a+b;
}
console.log(g);		// prints out 1;
foo(2,3);
console.log(g);		// prints out 5;</div>

</div>
