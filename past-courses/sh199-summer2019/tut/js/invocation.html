<h1> Creating a node.js (JavaScript) script/program </h1>
<p> In this class we run JavaScript programs via <a href='http://nodejs.org'> node.js </a>
which allows us to run JavaScript as command line programs.  This gives us an
environment which is similar to those used by C or C++ which will be learned in
later CS courses, while potentially being a bit easier for the beginner.

<p> A node JavaScript program is just a text file that begins with the following
first line:
<div class=code>#!/usr/local/bin/node</div>
<br>

and the remainder of the text file is the JavaScript program itself.  The 
characters <kbd>#!</kbd> inform the operating system that the program that 
follows should interpret the text that follows. <kbd>/usr/local/bin/node</kbd> 
is then the path to the node interpreter.  An interpreter is simply a program 
that reads source (the program you write) and "interprets" it by carrying out 
the instructions laid out by the source.

<p>What follows is a simple program example.  It is often referred to as a
"Hello, world!" program.  A program traditionally written first by someone
learning a new programming language.

<div class=code>#!/usr/local/bin/node

console.log("Hello, world!");</div>

<p> The above text can be saved into a text file and then made into an "executable"
JavaScript program (i.e. it can be "run", just like any other Unix command, such
as ls or cp or your favorite editor (i.e. kate)) by setting the execute permissions
on the text file.

<p> Supposing the above was saved as the file <kbd>hello.js</kbd>, we can make
it executable by performing the following "chmod" command, and then we can run it

<div class=term>cs15199@cs:~/> chmod a+rx hello.js
cs15199@cs:~/> ./hello.js
Hello, world!
cs15199@cs:~/>
</div>

<p> Let us now deconstruct the one and only <i>statement</i> -- a command or
instruction to the computer to be carried out. In our "Hello, world!"
program, reading it from left to right: First is the word "console". 
<b>console</b> is a JavaScript object that represents a collection of
properties (think names and values) and methods (often called functions or
smaller, self contained programs within the larger program) that relate to
outputting text to the console or in our case, the terminal window.  The next
word "log" refers to one of the methods within the console object that outputs
its input (which we'll get into shortly) to the console.  There are other
methods, such as "error", "warn" and "info" which more or less do the same thing
in our case, but if you ever use JavaScript in a browser, allows the system to
route the messages differently.

<p> Your browser has a console, similar to your terminal window.  It can be
accessed usually by pressing the key combination <kbd>Ctrl-Shift-j</kbd> or
<kbd>Ctrl-Shift-k</kbd>.  You might also be able to access it from your browsers
menus via <b>Tools &rarr; Web Developer &rarr; Web Console</b> or the like.

<p> The next item of interest are the <kbd>()</kbd>'s that contain the
<i>string</i> <b> "Hello, world!"</b>.  The <kbd>()</kbd> are the "call"
operator and the data inside of it, separated by commas are the <i>parameters</i>
to the <i>function call</i>.  So the string "Hello, world!" is passed to the log
function in the console object to be printed to the console log.

<p> And with that we have made our first JavaScript program.
