<h3 id='tut' tabindex=35> Tutors </h3>
<!--<p><a href='https://www.indstate.edu/services/student-success/cfss'> Center
  for Student Success (CFSS):</a> Sometimes provides tutors that students may
  sign up for free of charge to provide tutoring for their computer science
  courses (as well as others.)
</p>-->
<p>
  There is to my knowledge no tutoring available during the summer. Students
  wishing to have tutoring during the summer will have to seek any outside
  tutoring that might be available.
</p>

<h3 id='pre' tabindex=40> Prerequisites </h3>
  None.

<h3 id='st' tabindex=50> Standard text </h3>
  <p> There is no required text for this course.
  
  <p> Additional sources that can be used for the course include the following:

  <ul>
   <li> Blockly games <a href='https://blockly-games.appspot.com/'> https://blockly-games.appspot.com/ </a>
  </ul>

<h3 id='ca' tabindex=60> Course Announcements </h3>
  Announcements regarding the course will be made both during class and via
  email to your @sycamores.indstate.edu email address. You should regularly 
  check this email account or have it forwarded to an account that you check
  regularly. You can set the account to forward by logging into your
  indstate.edu email from Internet Explorer (the "light" version of the webmail
  client that opens up from Firefox or Chrome does not give the option to
  forward email).


<h3 id='cc' tabindex=70> Classroom conduct </h3>
  You may not use cell phones, iPods/music players, etc. during class. You
  should be civil and respectful to both the instructor and your classmates, and
  you should arrive to class a few minutes before the scheduled lecture so you
  are ready for lecture to begin on time. You may use your computer during class
  if you are using it to follow along with the examples that are being discussed.
  You may not check email, Facebook, work on other courses, etc. during class.


<h2 id='cd' tabindex=80> Course Description </h2>
  <p>The catalog description for this course is:</p>

<h2 id='gaa' tabindex=100> Grading and Assignments </h2>
  <p>The students of this course have the following responsibilities: read
  assigned  readings before lecture, attend lecture, complete homework
  assignments, take in class quizzes, take exams, and possibly complete a
  project. The final grade consists of: </p>

  <ul>
   <li><strong>Quizzes:</strong> 15% total.  There should be a quiz approximately
      once per week.  For blackboard quizzes you will be allowed to use your
      notes for the quiz, any other type of quiz, use of notes or Internet or
      crib sheets will be decided on a case-by-case basis.</li>
   <li><strong>Homework:</strong> 25% total. There will be a homework assignment
     most weeks. The total of all homework assignments is worth 25% of the final
     grade. If you turn in the assignment late, I may grade it at 80%. Homework
     turned in after I've discussed the assignment in class WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.
     NOTE: you may ask me to look over an assignment before it is due and I may
     help by pointing out mistakes that need correction and provide other
     feedback. </li>
   <li><strong>Exams:</strong> 60% total. We will have two exams. A mid-term
     worth ~100 points, and a final exam worth ~150 points.</li>
   <li><strong>Class Attendance/Participation:</strong> 0% total. Attendance
     will be taken at the beginning of each class. Each unexcused absence beyond
     2 will reduce your final grade by 10%, i.e. after 5 unexcused absences your
     final grade will be reduced 50% and you will receive an F in the course.
     </li>
  </ul>

<h3 id='lh' tabindex=110> Late Homework </h3>
  All homework assignments will be given a preferred due date. Assignments can
  be turned in past the preferred due date, but any assignments turned in late
  may have their value multiplied by 80% (so the highest grade you can get on
  a late assignment is 80%). Any assignment discussed in depth in class are
  effectively closed and no credit will be given.

<h3 id='she' tabindex=120> Start Homework Early </h3>
  I suggest attempting a homework assignment the day it is given, or the day
  after, so that if you have a problem you can ask early. If you continue to
  have problems in trying to complete the assignment, you will have time to ask
  again. Many of the homework assignments require thought and problem solving,
  which takes "time on the calendar" not just "time on the clock". By that I
  mean that spending an hour on 3 consecutive days is likely to be more
  productive than trying to spend 3 hours at once on the assignment.

<h3 id='eaow' tabindex=130> Expected Amount of Work </h3>
  My expectation is that an average student will spend about 4-6 hours OUTSIDE
  of class each week (that is in addition to class time) WORKING PRODUCTIVELY/
  EFFICIENTLY (not just staring at the computer) to complete their coursework
  for this class. Some students may spend less time than this, and some students
  will spend more.

<h3 id='gc' tabindex=140> Grade Cutoffs </h3>
  <p>Homework assignments and exams are designed so that a standard cutoff for
  grades will be close to what you deserve. After the first exam I will create a
  grade in Blackboard called "Letter Grade" that is what your letter grade would
  be if the semester ended today. Initially, I will assign the following grades:
  93-100 A, 90-93 A-, 87-90 B+, 83-87 B, 80-83 B-, 77-80 C+, 73-77 C, 70-73 C-,
  67-70 D+, 63-67 D, 60-63 D-, 0-60 F </p>

  My goal is that the different grades have the following rough meaning.<br>
  <p><b>A+/A</b><br>
    You understand everything and probably could teach the course yourself.</p>

  <p><b>B+/A-</b><br>
    You understand nearly everything, and should be all set to use this knowledge
    in other courses or in a job.</p>

  <p><b>C/C+/B-/B</b><br>
    Some things you understand very well and others you don't (more towards the
    former for a B and more towards the latter for a C).</p>

  <p><b>D-/D+/C-</b><br>
    You did put some effort in, and understand many things at a high level, but
    you haven't mastered the details well enough to be able to use this knowledge
    in the future.</p>

  <p><b>F</b><br>
    Normally, students that get an F simply stopped doing the required work at
    some point.</p>

<h3 id='bb' tabindex=150> Blackboard </h3>
  The course has a blackboard site. Click <a href='https://blackboard.indstate.edu/'>
  https://blackboard.indstate.edu/</a> to go to blackboard. You should see this
  course listed under your courses for the current term. The blackboard site is
  only used for giving you your grades. All course content, schedule, etc. is
  kept in this web site (which you are currently viewing).

<h2 id='cs' tabindex=155> CS Course Policies </h2>
  Note that this course follows all standard CS course policies.  In particular,
  <b>(a)</b> cheating/plagiarism by graduate students results in an F in the
  course, <b>(b)</b> missing 20% of the classes results in an F for any student,
  and <b>(c)</b> there will be no makeup exams.  See
  <a href='http://cs.indstate.edu/info/policies.html'>
  http://cs.indstate.edu/info/policies.html </a> for details. My attendance
  policy is further amended such that each unexcused absence beyond 2 will
  reduce your final grade by 10%.

<h2 id='ai' tabindex=160> Academic Integrity </h2>
  Please follow these guidelines to avoid problems with academic misconduct in
  this course:

  <ul>
   <li><b> Homework:</b> You may discuss the homework assignments, but should
     solve and finish them on your own. To make sure you are not violating this,
     if you discuss with someone, you should DESTROY any work or evidence of the
     discussion, go your separate ways, SPEND at least an hour doing something
     completely unrelated to the assignment, and then you should be able to
     RECREATE the program/solution on your own, then turn that in. If you cannot
     recreate the solution on your own, then it is not your work, and you should
     not turn it in.
   <li><b>Note on sources:</b> if you use some other source, the web or
     whatever, you better cite it! Not doing so is plagiarism.  <b>If you work
     with or discuss the assignment with someone else, make a note of it in the
     comments to your code.</b>
   <li><b>Exams:</b> This should be clear no cheating during exams. The exams
     will be closed-book, closed-notes, no computer, and no calculator. You may
     be allowed one sheet of 8.5" by 11" piece of paper with <b>hand-written</b>
     notes to use as a crib-sheet for your tests.
   <li><b>Projects:</b> You should not copy from the Internet or anywhere else.
     The project should be your own work. It will be fairly obvious to me if you
     do copy code from the Internet, and the consequences will be at the least a
     0 on the project. You may on a case by case basis be allowed to use some
     code snippets as long as you attribute the original source. 
  </ul>

  <p>If cheating is observed, you will at the least receive a 0 for the assignment
  (and may receive an F for the course), and I will file a Notification of
  Academic Integrity Violation Report with Student Judicial Programs, as
  required by the university's policy on Academic Integrity. A student who is
  caught cheating twice (whether in a single course or different courses) is
  likely to be brought before the All University Court hearing panel, which can
  impose sanctions up to and including suspension/expulsion. See the
  <a href='http://www.indstate.edu/sjp/docs/code.pdf'> http://www.indstate.edu/sjp/docs/code.pdf</a>
  and
  <a href='http://www.indstate.edu/academicintegrity/'> http://www.indstate.edu/academicintegrity/</a>
  for more information.</p>

  <p>Please ask the instructor if you have doubts about what is considered cheating
  in this course.</p>

<h2 id='sn' tabindex=170> Special Needs / Disability Services </h2>
  <p> Indiana State University recognizes that students with disabilities may
  have special needs that must be met to give them equal access to college
  programs and facilities. If you need course adaptations or accommodations
  because of a disability, please contact us as soon as possible in a
  confidential setting either after class or in my office. All conversations
  regarding your disability will be kept in strict confidence. Indiana State
  University's Student Support Services (SSS) office coordinates services for
  students with disabilities: documentation of a disability needs to be on file
  in that office before any accommodations can be provided. Student Support
  Services is located on the lower level of Normal Hall in the Center for
  Student Success and can be contacted at 812-237-2700, or you can visit the ISU
  website under A-Z, Disability Student Services and submit a Contact Form.
  Appointments to discuss accommodations with SSS staff members are encouraged.
  Once a faculty member is notified by Student Support Services that a student
  is qualified to receive academic accommodations, a faculty member is obligated
  to provide or allow a reasonable classroom accommodation under ADA. Faculty
  should contact Rita Worrall at 237-2301 or Debbie Huckabee at 237-7920 for
  questions about or assistance with accommodations for students with
  disabilities.

<!--  <p> If you have special needs for the classroom environment, homework, or
  quizzes, please inform the instructor during the first week of classes. If you
  have any such needs, you should go to the Student Academic Services Center to
  coordinate this. See <a href='http://www.indstate.edu/sasc/programs/dss/services.htm'>
  http://www.indstate.edu/sasc/programs/dss/services.htm</a> for more
  information.</p>-->

<h2 id='drsm' tabindex=180> Disclosures Regarding Sexual Misconduct </h2>
  <p> Indiana State University fosters a campus free of sexual misconduct
  including sexual harassment, sexual violence, intimate partner violence, and
  stalking and/or any form of sex or gender discrimination. If you disclose a
  potential violation of the sexual misconduct policy I will need to notify the
  Title IX Coordinator. Students who have experienced sexual misconduct are
  encouraged to contact confidential resources listed below. To make a report
  or the Title IX Coordinator, visit the Equal Opportunity and Title IX website:
