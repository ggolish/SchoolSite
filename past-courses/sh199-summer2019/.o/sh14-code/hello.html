 <h2>Advice</h2>
 <p>
   From Mr. Gresham and the Peru mission trip folks (and maybe they got it from somewhere else) - be here now, be there then.
   Aka, whatever it is you are doing right now, do it well.

 <h2>Something I learned today or yesterday</h2>
 <p>
   Orange County, CA, treats its waste water and pumps it back into the ground (to eventually make it back into the
   drinking supply).

 <h2>What I want to do</h2>
 <p>
   When I was in high school, I always thought I wanted to be a professor.  I had fun at school and thought I'd just
   do that forever.  I was interested in many subjects - math, physics, history, theology, spanish, ...  I ended
   up majoring in CS, math, and spanish.  For grad school, I was considering CS or math.  I decided to go with
   theoretical CS, something kind of in between.
